This folder contains experiments in calculating the frequencies of
linkographs obtained with a given shannon entropy occur when using a
given ontology.

The Shannon entropy calculated is the Shannon entropy applied to the
whole linkograph as given by the H = -p*log_2(p) - q*log_2(q) where p
is the percentage of links present and q is the percentage of links
not present.
