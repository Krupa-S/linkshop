grrcon_example
  Contains the supporting files for running an example from the
  ecrypted grrcon file grrcon-encoded.json to an svg-html and
  postscript representation. More information about the example can be
  found in the exampleReadme.txt in this folder.

hackTestFiles
  These are scripts and files that were used to test
  linkoCreate.createLinko, linkoCreate.writeLinkoJson,
  linkoCreate.readLinkoJson, labels.labelCommands. They are not
  official tests.

labels.py
  labelCommands -- takes a json command file and a json label file and
  creates a label object and optionally a json file. See the docstring
  for more details.

linkoCreate.py
  Linkograph -- class definition of the Linkograph object. A
  Linkograph extends a list to allow for adding attributes. The only
  default attribute is a list of the labels.

  writeLinkoJson -- handles writing a Linkograph to json files.

  readLinkoJson -- handles reading a Linkograph from a json file.

  readLinkoCSV -- creates a Linkograph from a CSV file.

  createLinko -- creates a Linkograph from a label object json and a
  rule json.

linkoDraw.py
  linkoDrawEPS -- creates a postscript file from a Linkograph.

linkoSVG.py
  linkoDrawSVG -- creates an SVG representation from a Linkograph.

markov.py
  createMarkov -- Creates a Markov model of the linkograph.

runTest.py -- script for running the unittests.

stats.py
  Statistic functions for analyzing linographs.

  totalLinks -- gives the number of possible links for a linkograph

  totalLabels -- Gives the frequency of each label.

  percentageOfEntries -- Gives the percentage of lines with each
  label.

  links -- Counts the number of links.

  linkCount -- Counts the number of links in a list passed. This
  function is a helper function for other functions.

  linkTotal -- Calculates the total possible links along a line. This
  function is a helper function for other functions.

  percentageOfLinks -- Gives the percentage of links.

  graphEntropy -- Gives the Shannon Entropy for the linkograph.

  shannonEntropy -- The bare Shannon entropy function.

  linkEntropy -- Calculates forelink and backlink entropies.

tests
  This folder has the unit tests that are ran by runTest.py.
