DESCRIPTION

Here is where the evolving "Abstraction" (how commands are categorized into higher abstractions) and "Ontology"
(how those abstracted states are related to each other) are maintained.

FILES AND DIRS

abstraction.json  ........................  Nominal abstraction of Windows cmd shell commands
ontology.json  ...........................  Symbolic link to the current choice of ontology
dot2svg.sh  ..............................  Creates svg graphs from graphviz (*.dot) files.
                                            ("dot2svg.sh ontology" should create ontology.svg from ontology.json)
v1/  .....................................  Version 1 was built at a lower level of abstraction ( LookDisk != LookNet)
v2/  .....................................  Assumes a small number of states (Look, Transfer, Execute, Move, Cleanup),
                                            but has many inter-state links
v3/  .....................................  Will have *only* states linked that show forward *progress*
vself/ ...................................  Self-loop ontology for
